# Platform Invaders

A cross-platform **2D game development library** for **macOS** and **Windows**, built using **C++** and **Objective-C**.  

This project was developed during my **second year of university** as a team project with **6 other developers**, under the supervision of our sponsor [**Feral Interactive**](https://www.feralinteractive.com/en/).  

The repository includes:
- The **library source code**
- **Three example games** built with the library:
  - Snake
  - Pong 
  - Space Invaders  

The library is lightweight and flexible, making it a good starting point for creating your own **2D games** or other graphical programs.
